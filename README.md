## Info

A comparison study between graph algorithms implemented in standard implementation with graphs represented as list of vertices and edges and algebraic implementation with graphs represented with adjacency matrix. Both were implemented in Java as part of master's thesis.
We implemented five algorithms that solve 2 different problems:
- clustering:
   - Peer pressure algorithm
   - Markov cluster algorithm
- shortest paths
   - Floyd Warshall algorithm
   - Bellman Ford algorithm
   - Dijkstra


Code is prepared to be tested in ALGator system (https://github.com/ALGatorDevel/Algator).
We compared algorithms on different test graphs.
The results show that standars implementation with graphs represented as list of vertices and edges is more time efficient as algebraic.
